# Access Demo

I saw a question on Microsof docs Q&A site about an error when getting data from an access database with c#.  For this app I used a .net 5 windows forms app.   The same steps should work with a .net framework app.


First I created a .net 5.0 windows forms app.   Then I added the NuGet Package System.Data.OleDb.
